## Tradeshow Floorplan Manager

This is a project built to simplify the trade show managing process.

It helps sales people consolidate their efforts and collaborate in real time with team mates.

Rather than track everything by paper, you can use this web app to keep track of all booths that you have sold or still need to collect on.  You can also differentiate between what you have sold along with what your teammates have sold!
