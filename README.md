# Tradeshow Floorplan Manager

This is a blazingly fast static site built upon stable modern technologies like React and Firebase with a goal to simplify the trade show management process.

Specifically, it helps marketers/sales people consolidate their efforts and collaborate in real time with speed.

Rather than track everything by paper, you can use this web app to keep track of all booths you are managing and **color code** them according to who is managing the booth.

## Prerequisites:

1.  [Nodejs & NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
3.  [Firebase tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools)

## Setup

### Available Scripts

* Scripts are available in the `package.json` file at the root level under the "**scripts**" property

##### Development Mode

```shell
npm run dev
```

##### Production Mode

```shell
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Changing Booth Layouts in Firebase

* Booth locations are computed based on **row**, **column** and **size** which defaults to 1x1
* Accepts an image url as the `image` key which will center & resize the custom image over the booth
* Accepts a custom `size` key which can be specified as `3x2` or whatever
* Firebase is NoSQL so if a key is not required, you don't have to specify it

#### Booth API

| Option        | Usage      | Type     |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `_id`         | _Required_ | `String` |
| `col`         | _Required_ | `Number` |
| `row`         | _Required_ | `Number` |
| `company`     | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `description` | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `image`       | _Optional_ | `Url`    |
| `num`         | _Optional_ | `Number` |
| `owner`       | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `size`        | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `status`      | _Optional_ | `String` |

Example:

```json
"yourroute": {
  "630": {
    "_id":"5910ae25529a13a5bf988a5e",
    "num":630,
    "row":1,
    "col":13,
    "owner":"Ryan",
    "status":"holding",
    "company":"Cool Company",
    "description":"The most ultra cool co in existence!"
  },
  "531": {  
    "_id":"5910b02a529a13a5bf988af7",
    "num":531,
    "row":-1,
    "col":12,
    "owner":"None",
    "status":"good",
    "company":"Another cool co",
		"size":"2x1",
		"image":"urlToImage.com"
	},
	"randomthing": {
		"_id":"5910b02a529a13a5bf988af7",
    "row":10,
    "col":14,
		"size":"5x10",
		"image":"urlToImage.com"
	}
}
```

* The second key under "yourroute" must be unique
	* One of the main reasons for it is **convenience** when trying to find a booth in the firebase console

### How To Deploy Firebase Functions And App To Firebase Hosting	

* To Set up Firebase head to: https://console.firebase.google.com
	* Proceed through the instructions to set up a new project.
	* Once you have completed those steps successfully, you can set up each of these sections below:

1. Make sure `.firebaserc` in the root of this project has your **project id**.
2. With `firebase-tools` installed you can run firebase from the command line

```
firebase login
```

* To get all your credentials

```
firebase setup:web
```

* Create a new file called `config.js` in the root of this repo with the file below
	* Add the credentials the `firebase setup:web` command prints out under the key `FIREBASE_CONFIG`
	* This file is in `.gitignore` so will not be committed because it contains secrets
	* Make sure the first letter of the owner names are captalized in both firebase db and the `config.js` `USER_MAP`

```js
const AUTHENTICATED_USER_EMAILS = [
	'email1@gmail.com',
	'email2@yahoo.com',
	...
]

const BOOTH_LAYOUT = {
	borderWidth: 2,
	columns: 18,
	dimension: 60,
	rows: 26,
}

// Click around your console.firebase.google to gather these values
const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
	apiKey: 'your api key',
	authDomain: 'tradeshow-floorplan.firebaseapp.com',
	databaseURL: 'https://tradeshow-floorplan.firebaseio.com/ ',
	projectId: 'tradeshow-floorplan',
	storageBucket: 'gs://tradeshow-floorplan.appspot.com',
}

/**
 * Allows you to create programmatic routes
 * You can pass a custom BOOTH_LAYOUT object for each page if you would like
 * https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/bound-action-creators/#createPage
 */
const FLOORPLAN_PAGES = [
	{
		name: 'Los Angeles',
		path: '/la',
		context: BOOTH_LAYOUT,
	},
	{
		name: 'Long Beach',
		path: '/lb',
		context: Object.assign({}, BOOTH_LAYOUT, { columns: 15, rows: 27 }),
	},
]

const USER_MAP = {
	Jin: {
		color: '#ff00aa',
		email: 'email1@gmail.com',
	},
	Richard: {
		color: '#0800FF',
		email: 'email2@yahoo.com',
	},
	Todd: {
		color: '#00B20E',
		email: 'email3@gmail.com',
	},
}

module.exports = {
	AUTHENTICATED_USER_EMAILS,
	FIREBASE_CONFIG,
	FLOORPLAN_PAGES,
	USER_MAP,
}
```

### Firebase Authentication:

* Only google auth is currently set up as provider

  ![Firebase Auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20076677/39107467-4c5c5fc8-4677-11e8-83d7-3461887f9e13.png)

### Firebase Database Rules:

[Firebase DB Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start?authuser=1)

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": "auth.token.email == 'email1@gmail.com' || auth.token.email == 'email2@yahoo.com'"
  }
}
```

### Firebase Storage Rules:

```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if false;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.email == 'email1@gmail.com' || request.auth.token.email == 'email2@yahoo.com';
    }
  }
}
```

### Firebase Functions:

* The only part of this app that would require a server is sending emails
* However, thanks to Firebase Functions, we can still have a **serverless** web app that is **blazingly fast**
* To run a **local** firebase shell:

```
npm run shell
```

* You can then call the email function directly from there if you would like to test it out

```
emailTeam()
```

* To only deploy functions rather than hosting run:

```
npm run deploy:functions
```

* Otherwise you can just call the function from the web app and check the Firebase function logs:
  ![Firebase Logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20076677/39110849-8d1089b2-4687-11e8-9659-06edfc1cf2af.png)

### Setting Up The Emailing Feature

* In the `functions` directory create a new file called `emailConfig.js` that has the content below
	* This file is in `.gitignore`

```js
// functions/emailConfig.js
const GMAIL_SETTINGS = {
	email: 'theEmailThatWillSendEmails@gmail.com',
	pass: 'password',
}

const RECIPIENT_EMAILS = [
	'email1@gmail.com',
	'email2@yahoo.com',
	...
]

module.exports = {
	GMAIL_SETTINGS,
	RECIPIENT_EMAILS,
}
```

* _If you need further help setting up your gmail to send emails, we use_ [Nodemailer so check out their docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/) 
* This project just uses a Gmail account to send emails
	* [Article on sending with a simple Gmail account](https://medium.com/@manojsinghnegi/sending-an-email-using-nodemailer-gmail-7cfa0712a799)


### How On-demand Backups Work

* On-demand backups store the firebase db in json format in firebase storage for easy retrieval
* The backups are launched when user visits site
* On-demand client side db backup max 1 backup per day
