It helps sales people consolidate their efforts and collaborate in real time with team mates.

Rather than track everything by paper, you can use this web app to keep track of all booths that you have sold or still need to collect on.  You can also differentiate between what you have sold along with what your teammates have sold!

## Steps to run in production

* Add a `.env` file to the root of directory
  * You can add as many emails as you want
  * It should like this:

```
GMAILUSER=yourgmail
GMAILPASS=yourpassword
USERS=[['fakeemail1@gmail.com', 'FirstName1'], ['fakeemail2@gmail.com', 'FirstName2'], ...]
```

* If you want to **change colors **they are in the `src/components/molecules/Booth/index.js` file

* Make sure to install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) and start it up by running

```shell
mongod
```

* It should start up and say listening on port `27017`
  * If it shows a different port specify it in the `package.json` file in the root of this project under the `mongo:port` script


* Then restore the backups into the database
  * Navigate to `backup` directory and restore each of the two collections

```shell
mongorestore --collection laBooths --db floorplan laBooths.bson
mongorestore --collection lbBooths --db floorplan lbBooths.bson
```

* It should say finished restoring floorplan.lbBooths (177 documents) or something like that

* then type this to open up a mongo shell

```shell
mongo
```

* once inside the shell type

```shell
show dbs
```

* floorplan should show up as one of the dbs

* then type

```shell
use floorplan
```

* It should say switched to db floorplan
