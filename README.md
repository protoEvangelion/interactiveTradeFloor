# Tradeshow Floorplan Manager

This is a project that's dynamic and built to simplify the trade show management process.

It

Specifically, it helps sales people consolidate their efforts and collaborate in real time with team mates.

Rather than track everything by paper, you can use this web app to keep track of all booths that you have **sold** or still need to **collect** on and **color code** it based on who the booth belongs to.

## Setup

### Available Scripts

* Scripts are available in the `package.json` file at the root level under the "**scripts**" property

##### Development Mode

```shell
npm run dev
```

##### Production Mode

```shell
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Changing booth layouts in Firebase

* Booth locations are computed based on **row**, **column** and **size** which defaults to 1x1
* Accepts an image url as the `image` key
* Accepts a custom `size` key which can be specified as `3x2` or whatever
* Firebase is NoSQL so if a key is not required, you don't have to specify it

#### Booth API

| Option        | Usage      | Type     |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `_id`         | _Required_ | `String` |
| `col`         | _Required_ | `Number` |
| `row`         | _Required_ | `Number` |
| `company`     | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `description` | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `image`       | _Optional_ | `Url`    |
| `num`         | _Optional_ | `Number` |
| `owner`       | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `size`        | _Optional_ | `String` |
| `status`      | _Optional_ | `String` |

Example:

```json
"yourroute": {
  "630": {
    "_id":"5910ae25529a13a5bf988a5e",
    "num":630,
    "row":1,
    "col":13,
    "owner":"Ryan",
    "status":"holding",
    "company":"Cool Company",
    "description":"The most ultra cool co in existence!"
  },
  "531": {  
    "_id":"5910b02a529a13a5bf988af7",
    "num":531,
    "row":-1,
    "col":12,
    "owner":"None",
    "status":"good",
    "company":"Another cool co",
		"size":"2x1",
		"image":"urlToImage.com"
	},
	"randomthing": {
		"_id":"5910b02a529a13a5bf988af7",
    "row":10,
    "col":14,
		"size":"5x10",
		"image":"urlToImage.com"
	}
}
```

* The second key under "yourroute" must be unique but is for convenience only when trying to find a booth in the firebase console.

## Prerequisites:

1.  [Nodejs & NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
3.  [Firebase tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools)

make sure owner names are first letter captalized in db and config
Ondemand client side db backup max 1 backup per day
How to deploy functions and app
package.json scripts

To Set up Firebase head to: https://console.firebase.google.com

Proceed through the instructions to set up a new project.

Once you have completed those steps successfully, you can set up each of these sections below:

Make sure `.firebaserc` in the root of this project has your project id.

With `firebase-tools` installed you can run firebase from the command line

```
firebase login
```

* To get all your credentials

```
firebase setup:web
```

* Add the credentials this command prints out in a new file called `config.js`
* This file is in `.gitignore`

```js
const AUTHENTICATED_USER_EMAILS = [
	'email1@gmail.com',
	'email2@yahoo.com',
	...
]

const BOOTH_LAYOUT = {
	borderWidth: 2,
	columns: 18,
	dimension: 60,
	rows: 26,
}

// Click around your console.firebase.google to gather these values
const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
	apiKey: 'your api key',
	authDomain: 'tradeshow-floorplan.firebaseapp.com',
	databaseURL: 'https://tradeshow-floorplan.firebaseio.com/ ',
	projectId: 'tradeshow-floorplan',
	storageBucket: 'gs://tradeshow-floorplan.appspot.com',
}

/**
 * Allows you to create programmatic routes
 * You can pass a custom BOOTH_LAYOUT object for each page if you would like
 * https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/bound-action-creators/#createPage
 */
const FLOORPLAN_PAGES = [
	{
		name: 'Los Angeles',
		path: '/la',
		context: BOOTH_LAYOUT,
	},
	{
		name: 'Long Beach',
		path: '/lb',
		context: Object.assign({}, BOOTH_LAYOUT, { columns: 15, rows: 27 }),
	},
]

const USER_MAP = {
	Jin: {
		color: '#ff00aa',
		email: 'email1@gmail.com',
	},
	Richard: {
		color: '#0800FF',
		email: 'email2@yahoo.com',
	},
	Todd: {
		color: '#00B20E',
		email: 'email3@gmail.com',
	},
}

module.exports = {
	AUTHENTICATED_USER_EMAILS,
	FIREBASE_CONFIG,
	FLOORPLAN_PAGES,
	USER_MAP,
}
```

## Firebase Authentication:

* Only google auth is currently set up as provider

  ![Firebase Auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20076677/39107467-4c5c5fc8-4677-11e8-83d7-3461887f9e13.png)

## Firebase Database Rules:

[Firebase DB Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start?authuser=1)

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": "auth.token.email == 'email1@gmail.com' || auth.token.email == 'email2@yahoo.com'"
  }
}
```

## Firebase Storage Rules:

```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if false;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.email == 'email1@gmail.com' || request.auth.token.email == 'email2@yahoo.com';
    }
  }
}
```

## Firebase Functions:

* The only part of this app that would require a server is sending emails
* However, thanks to Firebase Functions, we can still have a serverless web app that is blazingly fast
* To run a local firebase shell:

```
npm run shell
```

* You can then call the email function directly from there if you would like to test it out

```
emailTeam()
```

* To only deploy functions rather than hosting run:

```
npm run deploy:functions
```

* Otherwise you can just call the function from the web app and check the Firebase function logs:
  ![Firebase Logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20076677/39110849-8d1089b2-4687-11e8-9659-06edfc1cf2af.png)

### Setting up email

* This file is in `.gitignore`
* _If you need help setting up your gmail to send emails, we use_ [Nodemailer so check out their docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/) \* [Article on sending with a simple Gmail account](https://medium.com/@manojsinghnegi/sending-an-email-using-nodemailer-gmail-7cfa0712a799)
* Create a `emailConfig.js` file in your `functions` directory:

```js
// functions/emailConfig.js
const GMAIL_SETTINGS = {
	email: 'theEmailThatWillSendEmails@gmail.com',
	pass: 'password',
}

const RECIPIENT_EMAILS = [
	'email1@gmail.com',
	'email2@yahoo.com',
	...
]

module.exports = {
	GMAIL_SETTINGS,
	RECIPIENT_EMAILS,
}
```
